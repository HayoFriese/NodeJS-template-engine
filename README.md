# Welcome to the NodeJS Template

This is a NodeJS Template project with the following specs:
- [MaterializeCSS](http://materializecss.com/)
- [Express 4](http://expressjs.com/)
- [EJS Template Engine](http://ejs.co/)
- Works with [Heroku Hosting](https://heroku.com/apps)

The project serves to provide a quick base project organized in proper components to begin working with. The code is structured in a way that it's easy to pick up the basics such as routing and that all partials can be edited to a user's needs.

If you plan on using this template, I'd kindly request you add the following comment somewhere in the project:
